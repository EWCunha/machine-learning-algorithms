# Machine Learning ALgorithms

This is a repository of some machine learning algorithms implemented by myself. In my opinion, implementing algorithms by yourself is one of the best ways of learning a concept and grasping the intuition behind it. Please, if interested, fill free to use these algorithms and give me some feedback. I'd appreciate it!

## Implemented Algorithms
- Univariate linear regression
