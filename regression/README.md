# Linear Regression

In this folder, you'll find linear regression algorithms implemented by myself. In the following lines, I will explain and describe those algorithms with more detail.

## univariate_linear_regression.py

In this file you find my implementation of single variable linear regression using an analytical solution. I use NumPy library to take advantage of vectorization, which increases the code performance (i.e. computational speed). To understand the theory behind this, you can check [this article]().
